# Import from Notion to Cycle

[Notion](https://notion.so/) is a versatile tool for managing content and collaboration. This guide shows you how to use a script to import your Notion data directly into your Cycle inbox.

## What this script does

- Fetches each Notion page from your specified workspace.
- Retrieves relevant details and comments for each page.
- Marks all imported docs with an "imported" property, enabling filtered views and bulk deletion if needed. You can remove this property from your Cycle settings if it's no longer needed.

## How to use the script

1. Adapt the script to your need

2. Run `npm run import:notion`.
